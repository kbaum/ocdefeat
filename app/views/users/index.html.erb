<!-- Explanation:
In users#index, @filtered_users instance variable is defined,
so app/views/users/index.html.erb (this file) has access to @filtered_users instance variable
When an admin views the users index page,
the partial app/views/filter_users/_admin.html.erb is rendered from app/views/users/index.html.erb
The variable @filtered_users from the users index view file
is referenced in the partial app/views/filter_users/_admin.html.erb
as the local variable filtered_users.
When a therapist views the users index page,
the partial app/views/filter_users/_therapist.html.erb is rendered from app/views/users/index.html.erb
The variable @filtered_users from the users index view file
is referenced in partial app/views/filter_users/_therapist.html.erb
It's not good to use instance variables in a partial.
I want to display filtered users in an unordered list, and this code will be repeated frequently,
so I want to pass the local variable filtered_users
from app/views/filtered_users/_admin.html.erb and app/views/filtered_users/_therapist.html.erb
partials to app/views/users/_users_ul.html.erb partial
