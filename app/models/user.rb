# rejected_roles is an array of string roles the user does NOT want to be and
# role_number is the requested role's integer value
# so if we're looking for all unassigned users who want to be patients, we call
# User.awaiting_assignment(["Therapist", "Admin"], 1)
# we're looking for user instances who are NOT already patients (with role = 1)
# AND who did NOT request the roles of therapist or admin


# Explanation of #find_or_create_by_omniauth(auth_hash):
# Trying to find user instance by their provider attribute ("twitter") and their user ID (uid) on Twitter
# If such a user exists in the DB already, return that user instance
# If a user instance does NOT exist with that uid from Twitter, then create one:
# The newly instantiated user instance that was just created is passed to the block,
# we set its name attribute value = the name provided by Twitter -- auth_hash["info"]["name"],
# and we give it a random, unique string password using SecureRandom.hex
# The user instance is returned at end of method call
