# Explanation of #div_class_for_step(step):
# Calling #complete? on step instance returns true if status attribute value of step instance = 1
# If the step is complete (i.e. its status attribute = 1), then method returns the string "completed"
# which becomes the class attribute value of the div for the step -- <div class="completed">
# This is how we mark a step of the ERP plan as completed with a strike-through

# Explanation of #div_for_step(step):
# I'm create a <div> for the step record (instance)
# the string class attribute value of this <div> is the result of calling #div_class_for_step(step)
# Then we yield to the block. We end up in app/views/steps/_step_div.html.erb partial file,
# where #div_for_step(step) is called and passed a block, and the code in that block is executed

# Explanation of #set_step_status(step):
# We are submitting a form with some JS to change the status of a step to mark it as complete when we click
# Use nested resource form (with array)- we want to build a form_for this step of this plan
# We want to submit a form via a PUT/PATCH request to "/plans/:plan_id/steps/:id" routed to #update action of StepsController
# So the URL attribute of the form_for helper method is #plan_step_path(plan_instance, step_instance) - returns "/plans/:plan_id/steps/:id"
# But with the nested resource form, we don't have to specify the url attribute of form_for
# b/c Rails can guess the URL based on the object type of the 2 instances
# and we don't have to tell it the method is PATCH - Rails can guess this b/c the step of the plan is saved to the DB
# |f| is the FormBuilder object given to us when we called form_for.
# Inside of this form builder is an object which refers to the step that we're building the form for.
# We're telling it that we want to build a checkbox for the status attribute of this step,
# I want to give that checkbox a class attribute value of "toggle"
# and the checked attribute of the checkbox should be true if the step is complete (#complete? called on step returns true if step's status = 1)
# How checkboxes work in the browser:
# When you uncheck a checkbox, the browser does not submit any data, but when you check a checkbox, the browser does submit data
# Rails generates 2 <input>s (the first is a hidden <input>).
# In the event that you uncheck the checked checkbox,
# the hidden input field with a value of 0 will still submit
# If you DO check the checkbox, then the <input> with the same name attribute value of "step[status]"
# will overwrite the value of the always-submitted hidden step[status] <input> of value 0
# changing it from 0 to 1

# Explanation of #last_updated(step)
# The updated_at attribute of a step instance is something like "2018-04-11 18:09:52"
# strftime(*args) formats date according to the directives in the given format string.
# The directives begins with a percent (%) character.
# Any text not listed as a directive will be passed through to the output string.
# So using strftime, "Last modified on %A, %B %e, at %l:%M %p"
# %A - The full weekday name ("Wednesday")
# %B - The full month name ("April")
# %e - Day of the month, blank-padded (11)
# %l - Hour of the day, 12-hour clock, blank-padded (1..12)
# %M - Minute of the hour (00..59)
# %p - Meridian indicator, uppercase ("AM" or "PM")
