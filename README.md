# README
OCDefeat is a Ruby on Rails application that enables patients and mental health professionals to collaborate in the development and implementation of Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) plans, a therapy technique that is commonly used in the treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The premise of ERP is that patients develop anxiety tolerance and become habituated to fearful stimuli through repeated exposure to triggers and avoidance of ritualization.

During the registration process, prospective users request a role in the OCDefeat community. After their roles have been formally assigned by an admin, newly-minted OCDefeat patients can record their obsessions, voice their concerns about a particular obsession and establish personal goals for themselves when selecting a treatment approach and structuring ERP plans. Therapists, who are assigned a patient caseload by the admin, can add OCD themes in which to classify their patients' obsessions, filter obsessions, provide advice about overcoming obsessions and facilitate the design of treatment plans by contributing, editing or deleting steps in each plan. OCDefeat administrators have the ability to assign roles and manage users accounts.
